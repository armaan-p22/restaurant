# Restaurant Page

## Project Description
The Restaurant Page project is a dynamic, interactive restaurant homepage built entirely using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. Inspired by The Odin Project's JavaScript course, this project practices DOM manipulation by generating the entire website content programmatically. The restaurant site features tabbed browsing with different views such as Home, Menu, and Contact.

## How It Works
- **Homepage:** Loads dynamically with an image, headline, and description about the restaurant.
- **Tabbed Navigation:** Use the buttons in the header to switch between Home, Menu, and Contact pages.
- **Dynamic Content:** All page content is created and injected into the page via JavaScript modules.
- **Responsive UI:** Styling is handled via CSS to ensure the site looks good on different devices.

## Features
- DOM creation of all page content.
- Tabbed browsing interface with event listeners to swap content.
- Modular structure with each tab content in its own JavaScript module.
- Separate CSS file for styling.
- Webpack configured for bundling the project.
- `.gitignore` file configured to exclude `node_modules` and `dist` directories.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, modular architecture)
- Webpack (module bundling and dev server)
- Git/GitHub for version control and deployment
